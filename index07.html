          <p> was born in Cape Verde in 1996. I lived there for 10 years and did my primary school there. I grew up with my grandmother because my parents were in Portugal creating stability for myself and my siblings to live at a later date. In 2007 I moved to Portugal with my siblings (older sister and younger brother). There I went to high school and college. During my time studying, I did a mechanics course and worked at a cars garage.
 In 2018 I moved to England on my own because I wanted a better future and wanted to find a career. After 2 months of living in England, i found job as a machine hygiene maintenance. However i knew no English so i decided to go to College to learn the language. I did this for 2 years and got a qualification. During my free time I have always enjoyed playing football, going to the gym & learning new things. I have always been curious with technology, using different softwares & how it functions. So during this time a curiosity to be involved in IT was sparked and I knew that I wanted to have a career involving technology.I heard about this opportunity and I thought it would be good experience to learn coding and to provide a good life for me and for my family.</p>
